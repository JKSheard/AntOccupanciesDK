# Initial set-up

## Load packages
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

## Load data
```{r}
detections <- read.csv("C:/Users/julie/Documents/Projects/Occupancy/data/detections_decades.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```

# Create figure S3
Summarise and plot the proportion of visits with list lengths of one, two, three or more than three species recorded for each dataset

```{r}
tally<-detections %>%
    group_by(origin) %>%
    summarize("More than three" = sum(detections > 3), #visits with more than 3 species recorded
              "Three" = sum(detections == 3), #Visits with exactly 3 species recorded
              "Two" = sum(detections == 2), #Visits with exactly 2 species recorded
              "One" = sum(detections == 1)) #Visits with exactly 1 species recorded


output <- gather(tally,Species,count,-origin)

output$Species <- factor(output$Species, levels = c("More than three", "Three", "Two", "One"))
```

## Save figure
```{r}
